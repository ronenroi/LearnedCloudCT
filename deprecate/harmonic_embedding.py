        Given an input tensor `x` of shape [minibatch, ... , dim],
        the harmonic embedding layer converts each feature
        in `x` into a series of harmonic features `embedding`,
        where for each i in range(dim) the following are present
        in embedding[...]:
            ```
            [
                sin(x[..., i]),
                sin(f_1*x[..., i]),
                sin(f_2*x[..., i]),

        where N corresponds to `n_harmonic_functions`, and f_i is a scalar
        denoting the i-th frequency of the harmonic embedding.

        If `logspace==False`, frequencies are linearly spaced between
        `1.0` and `2**(n_harmonic_functions-1)`:

                1.0, 2**(n_harmonic_functions-1), n_harmonic_functions
            )`

        Note that `x` is also premultiplied by the base frequency `omega0`
        before evaluating the harmonic functions.
